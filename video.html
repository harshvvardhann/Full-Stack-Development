    <!-- Poster: used as a thumbnail...and for that we need to remove the preload and autoplay bcoz if autoplay is on then on loading the browser the video will start automatically and we won't be able to show the thumbnail or poster. We can include the preload as it won't cause any wrong but for just sake you should remove. -->
